Using javascript was definitly of challenge to activate the progress counter and tallying up the users final marks to give a total of what they got. 
Instead I could only display what the right answers were.
Having position everything properly in css was hard too and took the most tim, there some parts that i wish i could figure out with my section tag maybe
I could have used another to give the submit button its own section?
